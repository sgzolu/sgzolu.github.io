                    <div class="abstract">We demonstrate that Southern elephant seals adjust their diving respiratory air volume (DRAV) depending on their tissue density and maximum dive depth. While lung oxygen stores comprise only a small portion of total oxygen stores, DRAV adjustment primarily benefits divers by reducing swimming costs. However, seals cannot minimize swimming costs solely through DRAV adjustment, suggesting individuals in poor body condition face increased energetic demands.</div>

                    <div class="abstract">3S (Sea mammals and Sonar Safety) is a multidisciplinary and international collaboration studying how naval sonar affects cetaceans. The goal is to gain information necessary to manage the risk to cetaceans without unnecessarily restricting naval sonar activities. One of the objectives of phase 4 of the 3S project (3S4) is to investigate if exposure to Continuous Active Sonar (CAS) leads to different types or severity of behavioral responses than exposure to traditional Pulsed Active Sonar (PAS) signals. Another is to investigate empirically if responses from short duration experiments predict responses from longer duration exposures conducted over an operationally relevant duration. The 3S-2023 trial was conducted off the coast of Norway in October–November 2023 to collect data to address these research questions. The purpose of this report is to summarize and document the data collected.</div>
